# Developer blacklist

Hi there! You have probably landed on this page because you either googled a developer's name or are actually looking for a "developers blacklist" and now wonder: what is this all about?

Simple: over the last couple of years there were numerous scam projects within and outside of the crypto space. And if managers of the failed projects that stole money from their investors are well-traced on the Internet, we noticed that some developers who actively participated in scamming innocent people feel no guilt. This website intends to fulfill the following tasks:

1. Provide Internet traceability for developers who knowingly participate in scam projects and leave evidence.
2. Push developers into thinking thousand times before signing up onto a scam project (hence, rendering scam project jobs either uneducated or unfillable — both preventing them from launching a scam product).

You can suggest new developers or submit edits through opening an issue or a pull request at [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/backmeupplz/developerblacklist) or filling out [the form](https://forms.gle/zvpdHtihWrR5z48D6).

> Most of the list initially will be derived from ["Avocado Approves" community Honest Reviews](https://medium.com/golden-borodutch/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mcafee-approves-1a308d05ce72).

> All the data on this website is taken from public sources and is not subject to be removed by any laws of any country. If you do want to remove the data — first inquire within the open sources where the data is derived from.

> This website can neither serve as a punishment nor aim at bringing anything negative to the people listed. If one thinks that simply publishing a list of names connected to their work experience can hurt anyone — then the blame is not on the list but on the experience itself. This website serves solely as a recording mechanism — it simply archives public information. It doesn't judge — readers of this website derive their conclusions themselves.
