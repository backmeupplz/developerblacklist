# Developer blacklist

Hi there! You probably landed on this page because you either googled a developer's name or are actually looking for a "developers blacklist" and now wonder: what is it all about?

Simple: over the last couple of years there were numerous scam projects within and outside of crypto space. And if managers of the failed projects that stole money from their investors are well-traced on the Internet, we noticed that some developers who actively participated in scamming innocent people feel no guilt. This website intends to fullfil the following tasks:

1. Provide Internet traceability for developers who knowingly participate in scam projects and leave evidence (hence, saving employers from hiring immoral beings).
2. Push developers into thinking thousand times before signin up onto a scam project (hence, rendering scam project jobs either uneducated or unfillable — both preventing them from launching a scam product).

You can suggest new developers or submit edits through openina an issue or a pull request at [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/backmeupplz/developerblacklist).

> Most of the list initially will be derived from ["McAfee Approves" community Honest Reviews](https://medium.com/golden-borodutch/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mcafee-approves-1a308d05ce72).

> All the data on this website is taken from _public sources_ and is not subkect to be removed by any laws of any countries. If you do want to remove the data — first inquire within the open sources where the data is derived from.
